# Sourabh Kumar Daksh

I am a recovering bioinformatician and Research Software Engineer, responsible for developing
[The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/).

I have been developing R packages in the realms of population genetics, epidemiology, reproducible research, and publication since 2012.
I enjoy cats 🐈‍⬛, baking 🥖, mushroom hunting 🍄, bad horror movies 👻, and good speculative fiction 📚.  

Some of my projects include:

## Projects

- [`TrioExome-Analysis`](https://github.com/bioinfosourabh/TrioExome-Analysis):  
  Clinical pipeline for trio-based whole exome sequencing with automated annotation and priortization.

- [`Variant-Prioritizer`](https://github.com/bioinfosourabh/Variant-Prioritizer):  
  Framework for deleterious variant classification integrating CADD, SIFT, and dbNSFP.

- [`WGS-AMR`](https://github.com/bioinfosourabh/WGS-AMR-Ecoli):  
  Whole genome sequencing pipeline for identifying antimicrobial resistance markers.

- [`Single-Cell-Analysis`](https://github.com/bioinfosourabh/Single-Cell-Analysis):  
  Single Cell Data Analysis Workflow using the Seurat package
