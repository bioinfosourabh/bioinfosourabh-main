I am a Bioinformatics Scientist at [Metropolis Healthcare](https://www.metropolisindia.com/)
supporting a fanastic team of support of clinical and wet-lab scientists.
I am the former Research Scientist at [All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi](https://aiims.edu/index.php/en) contributing to national genomic research projects using whole-exome, whole-genome, and transcriptomic data.
This work supported the development of a validated genomic analysis framework forming the basis of a national pediatric solid tumour gene panel.
I’m trained in the [population genetics of clonal plant
pathogens](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr/) and have a strong passion for
creating user-friendly and sensible computational tools in R.

This site serves as my personal site where I can blog about various subjects
including R programming, reproducible science, and population genetics.
