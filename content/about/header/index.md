I am a Bioinformatics Scientist at [Metropolis Healthcare](https://www.metropolisindia.com/)
supporting a fanastic team of clinical and wet-lab scientists.
I am the former Research Scientist at [All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi](https://aiims.edu/index.php/en) contributing to genomic research projects. This work supported the development of a validated genomic analysis framework forming the basis of a national pediatric solid tumour gene panel.
I’m trained in the computational analysis of next-generation sequencing data in clinical and translational genomics, with applications across oncology and inherited disorders.

This site serves as my personal space where I document and discuss genome-scale data analysis, clinical sequencing studies, and methods for maintaining analytical clarity and reproducibility in genomic research.
