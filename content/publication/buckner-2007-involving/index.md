abstract: "Pediatric hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in children and is frequently associated with dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In this study, we identify and characterize novel mutations in the CTNNB1 gene in pediatric hepatoblastoma patients. Through detailed genomic analysis, we demonstrate how these mutations contribute to aberrant β-catenin activity and tumor pathogenesis. Our findings expand the mutational landscape of CTNNB1 in hepatoblastoma and provide mechanistic insights into disease development, with potential implications for molecular diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies."
