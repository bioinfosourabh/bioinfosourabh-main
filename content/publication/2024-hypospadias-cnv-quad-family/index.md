abstract: >
  The genetic aetiology of hypospadias is likely to be oligogenic with possible
  interactions between multiple genetic variants and contributory environmental
  factors. A pathogenic copy number variant (CNV) is usually harboured by 3–14%
  of patients with rare developmental disorders. With this background, a
  landscape of CNVs in a family with multiple affected and unaffected progeny
  is presented with an investigation into the potentially responsible molecular
  pathways underlying the etiopathogenesis of hypospadias.

  The family consists of both parents, two sons with hypospadias, and two
  unaffected sons (whole exome data unavailable for one unaffected son). CNVkit
  pipeline was executed and structural variant files were annotated. Identified
  CNVs were analysed for inheritance, gene composition, and correlation with
  phenotype.

  Cumulative analysis identified 152 unique CNVs (1.49 kb–6.53 Mb), comprising
  139 deletions and 13 duplications. A significant proportion of CNVs in affected
  progeny were de novo. Several CNVs encompassed genes relevant to hypospadias,
  including GREM1, RRN3, KIAA0753, and HNF1B. De novo CNVs involving OR2J1 and
  OR14J1, expressed in testis and spermatozoa, were also identified.

  This study presents a comprehensive CNV landscape in familial hypospadias to
  enhance understanding of their distribution, frequency, and potential role
  in disease pathogenesis, and provides a resource for future research.
