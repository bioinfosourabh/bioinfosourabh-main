abstract: >
  Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of male genitalia with significant
  heritability and familial recurrence, particularly in consanguineous families.
  This study explored the role of KMT2C polymorphisms in a Yemeni family with two
  affected siblings. Comprehensive analysis identified 475 unique single
  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KMT2C, with 59 variants shared between both
  parents, suggesting common ancestry.

  Functional interaction analysis revealed links between KMT2C and genes such as
  MAP3K1, ATRX, and CHD7, which are implicated in sex differentiation and genital
  development. Novel findings included a deleterious BAHD1 mutation and a de novo
  rs201834857 variant associated with Kleefstra syndrome 2. These results
  underscore the multifactorial etiology of hypospadias, integrating genetic,
  epigenetic, and environmental contributors, and highlight the need for further
  investigation in diverse populations.
