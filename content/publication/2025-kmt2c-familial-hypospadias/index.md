  Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of male genitalia with significant
  heritability and familial recurrence, particularly in consanguineous families.
  This study explored the role of KMT2C polymorphisms in a Yemeni family with two
  affected siblings. Comprehensive analysis identified 475 unique single
  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KMT2C, with 59 variants shared between both
  parents, suggesting common ancestry.

  Functional interaction analysis revealed links between KMT2C and genes such as
  MAP3K1, ATRX, and CHD7, which are implicated in sex differentiation and genital
  development. Novel findings included a deleterious BAHD1 mutation and a de novo
  rs201834857 variant associated with Kleefstra syndrome 2. These results
  underscore the multifactorial etiology of hypospadias, integrating genetic,
  epigenetic, and environmental contributors, and highlight the need for further
  investigation in diverse populations.

## Abstract

### Background
Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of the male genitalia with significant
heritability and familial recurrence, particularly in consanguineous families.
Despite this, the underlying genetic architecture remains incompletely
understood, especially in non-European populations.

### Objective
To investigate the role of *KMT2C* polymorphisms in the etiopathogenesis of
familial hypospadias using a pedigree-based genomic approach.

### Methods
A Yemeni family with two affected siblings was investigated using comprehensive
genetic analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the *KMT2C* gene
were identified and analysed for inheritance patterns, functional relevance, and
gene–gene interactions. Variant interpretation was supported by interaction and
pathway analyses involving genes implicated in sex differentiation and genital
development.

### Results
A total of 475 unique SNPs were identified in *KMT2C*, of which 59 variants were
shared between both parents, suggesting a shared ancestral background. Functional
interaction analysis revealed associations between *KMT2C* and key genes,
including *MAP3K1*, *ATRX*, and *CHD7*, which are known to play roles in sex
differentiation. Novel findings included a deleterious *BAHD1* mutation and a de
novo rs201834857 variant associated with Kleefstra syndrome 2.

### Conclusion
This study highlights the multifactorial etiology of hypospadias, integrating
genetic, epigenetic, and environmental contributors. The findings expand the
understanding of *KMT2C*-associated genetic variation in familial hypospadias and
underscore the need for further investigation in larger and ethnically diverse
cohorts.
