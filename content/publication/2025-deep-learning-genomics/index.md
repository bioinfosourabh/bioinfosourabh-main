  The convergence of next-generation sequencing and advanced computational
  methods has reshaped genomic analysis by enabling unprecedented volumes of
  molecular data to be generated and analysed. This chapter surveys the rapidly
  evolving landscape of deep genomics, highlighting how advances in deep learning
  frameworks—including Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks,
  Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks—enable detection, characterization,
  and interpretation of complex genetic alterations.

  The chapter traces the transition from traditional bioinformatics pipelines
  to modern neural architectures capable of identifying fine-grained molecular
  signals. Convolutional Neural Networks discern localized sequence motifs,
  Recurrent Neural Networks capture sequential dependencies in expression data,
  Transformers model long-range regulatory interactions, and Graph Neural
  Networks elucidate gene–gene and protein–protein interaction networks. These
  approaches collectively provide a powerful framework for understanding how
  genetic variants propagate effects across biological systems.
