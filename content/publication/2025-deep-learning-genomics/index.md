## Abstract

### Background
The convergence of next-generation sequencing technologies and advanced
computational methods has fundamentally reshaped genomic analysis, enabling the
generation and interrogation of unprecedented volumes of molecular data. This
shift has accelerated the need for scalable and intelligent approaches capable
of capturing complex biological patterns embedded within genome-sequenced data.

### Scope of the Chapter
This chapter surveys the rapidly evolving field of deep genomics, highlighting
how modern deep learning frameworks—including Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs)—facilitate the detection, characterization, and interpretation of diverse
genetic alterations.

### Methodological Advances
The chapter traces the transition from traditional bioinformatics pipelines to
contemporary neural architectures capable of identifying fine-grained molecular
signals. CNNs are shown to excel at detecting localized sequence motifs, RNNs
capture dynamic and sequential dependencies in expression data, Transformers
model long-range regulatory interactions, and GNNs elucidate gene–gene and
protein–protein interaction networks.

### Implications
By integrating these complementary deep learning approaches, deep genomics
provides a powerful framework for understanding how individual genetic variants
can propagate effects across biological systems. The methodologies discussed
offer valuable insights for variant prioritization, functional interpretation,
and systems-level understanding of genome-sequenced data.
