abstract: "Pediatric hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in children and is frequently associated with dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In this study, we identify and characterize novel mutations in the CTNNB1 gene in pediatric hepatoblastoma patients. Through detailed genomic analysis, we demonstrate how these mutations contribute to aberrant β-catenin activity and tumor pathogenesis. Our findings expand the mutational landscape of CTNNB1 in hepatoblastoma and provide mechanistic insights into disease development, with potential implications for molecular diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies."

## Abstract
Background
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary malignant liver tumor in children, with alterations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway implicated in up to 90% of cases. The CTNNB1, which codes for β-catenin protein, plays a crucial role in this pathway, but its mutation landscape across diverse populations requires further investigation.
Objectives
To analyse and characterize the genetic variations in the CTNNB1 across three geographically diverse cohorts of hepatoblastoma patients and understand their potential pathogenic mechanisms.
Methods
The exome data for 54 hepatoblastoma tissue samples was subjected to quality control and alignment to GRCh38. SNVs were identified using GATK/Mutect2 and annotated using multiple databases. CTNNB1 gene variants were filtered and analyzed using cBioPortal, CONSURF 3.0, STRING database, and VarElect for comprehensive molecular and phenotypic analysis.
Results
CTNNB1 mutations were identified in 88.9% of patients, with 21 unique variants found in 24 patients post-filtering. Exon 3 was most frequently affected, with 17 unique mutations present in 91.66% of mutation-positive patients. The most common variants were c.101G > T (p.Gly34Val), c.98C > T (p.Ser33Phe), and c.98C > A (p.Ser33Tyr). Novel mutations were identified at positions S29 and I35, while additional variations were found in exons 4, 7, 10, and 13.
Conclusion
This study identified significant CTNNB1 genetic variations in hepatoblastoma, confirming exon 3 as a critical mutational hotspot. The findings enhance our understanding of HB pathogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets, particularly in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These mutations may serve as valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for personalized treatment approaches in pediatric hepatoblastoma.
