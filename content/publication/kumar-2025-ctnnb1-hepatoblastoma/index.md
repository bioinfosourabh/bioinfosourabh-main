abstract: "Pediatric hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in children and is frequently associated with dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In this study, we identify and characterize novel mutations in the CTNNB1 gene in pediatric hepatoblastoma patients. Through detailed genomic analysis, we demonstrate how these mutations contribute to aberrant β-catenin activity and tumor pathogenesis. Our findings expand the mutational landscape of CTNNB1 in hepatoblastoma and provide mechanistic insights into disease development, with potential implications for molecular diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies."

## Abstract

### Background
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary malignant liver tumor in children,
with alterations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway implicated in up to 90%
of cases. The *CTNNB1* gene, which codes for the β-catenin protein, plays a crucial
role in this pathway, but its mutation landscape across diverse populations
requires further investigation.

### Objectives
To analyse and characterize the genetic variations in *CTNNB1* across three
geographically diverse cohorts of hepatoblastoma patients and understand their
potential pathogenic mechanisms.

### Methods
Exome data from 54 hepatoblastoma tissue samples were subjected to quality
control and alignment to the GRCh38 reference genome. Single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) were identified using GATK/Mutect2 and annotated using multiple databases.
*CTNNB1* gene variants were filtered and analysed using cBioPortal, CONSURF 3.0,
the STRING database, and VarElect for comprehensive molecular and phenotypic
characterisation.

### Results
*CTNNB1* mutations were identified in 88.9% of patients, with 21 unique variants
detected in 24 patients after filtering. Exon 3 was the most frequently affected
region, harbouring 17 unique mutations in 91.66% of mutation-positive patients.
The most common variants were c.101G>T (p.Gly34Val), c.98C>T (p.Ser33Phe), and
c.98C>A (p.Ser33Tyr). Novel mutations were identified at positions S29 and I35,
with additional variants observed in exons 4, 7, 10, and 13.

### Conclusion
This study identified significant *CTNNB1* genetic variations in hepatoblastoma,
confirming exon 3 as a critical mutational hotspot. These findings enhance our
understanding of hepatoblastoma pathogenesis and highlight potential therapeutic
targets within the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. The identified mutations
may also serve as valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for personalised
treatment strategies in paediatric hepatoblastoma.
