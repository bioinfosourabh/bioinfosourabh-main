  Spina bifida is a multifactorial neural tube defect resulting from complex
  interactions between genetic and environmental factors. While whole exome
  sequencing has identified several pathogenic variants in Indian cohorts, the
  contribution of chromosomal imbalances and long contiguous stretches of
  homozygosity (LCSHs) remains underexplored. Chromosomal microarray analysis
  (CMA) provides a powerful approach to detect such genomic alterations.

  In this pilot study, genomic DNA from three patients with spina bifida was
  analysed using the Affymetrix 750K high-density array platform to identify
  submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances and LCSHs. Detected variants were
  evaluated using public databases including the Database of Genomic Variants,
  ClinVar, and OMIM, followed by functional annotation of affected genes.

  Significant LCSHs involving genes critical to neural tube development,
  including SOX11, WNT7A, FZD9, SEMA3A, and VHL, were identified on chromosomes 2,
  3, and 7. Mosaic Klinefelter syndrome was detected in one patient, while another
  showed no clinically relevant abnormalities. These findings highlight the
  diagnostic value of CMA in uncovering clinically relevant genomic alterations
  in spina bifida.

  This study underscores the importance of integrating chromosomal microarray
  analysis into the genetic evaluation of spina bifida and supports larger-scale
  investigations in the Indian population.

## Abstract

### Background
The etiology of spina bifida is multifactorial, with the phenotype arising from
complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Although whole
exome sequencing has identified several pathogenic variants in Indian cohorts,
the role of chromosomal imbalances and long contiguous stretches of homozygosity
(LCSHs) remains largely unexplored. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) offers
a robust approach to detect such genomic aberrations and is therefore valuable
in the genetic evaluation of spina bifida.

### Objective
To identify LCSHs and chromosomal imbalances in patients with spina bifida using
chromosomal microarray analysis as a pilot investigation.

### Materials and Methods
Genomic DNA was isolated from three patients with spina bifida (P1: 10-year-old
female; P2: 1-year-old male; P3: 2.8-year-old male) and analysed using the
Affymetrix 750K high-density array platform. Submicroscopic chromosomal
imbalances and LCSHs were identified and cross-referenced with public databases,
including the Database of Genomic Variants, ClinVar, and OMIM, to assess their
clinical relevance. Functional annotation of affected genes was performed to
evaluate their roles in neural tube development.

### Results
CMA revealed significant LCSHs on chromosomes 2, 3, and 7, encompassing genes
critical to neural tube closure, including *SOX11*, *WNT7A*, *FZD9*, *SEMA3A*, and
*VHL*. Mosaic Klinefelter syndrome (25.9% mosaicism) was identified in the second
patient, while the third patient exhibited no clinically significant genomic
abnormalities. The detection of pathogenic chromosomal alterations in two of the
three cases highlights the diagnostic utility of CMA in spina bifida.

### Conclusions
This study provides valuable insights into the complex genetic landscape
underlying the multifactorial etiopathogenesis of spina bifida. The findings
underscore the importance of integrating chromosomal microarray analysis into
genetic workups and support the need for larger-scale investigations in the
Indian population.
