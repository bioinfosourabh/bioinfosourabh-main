abstract: >
  Spina bifida is a multifactorial neural tube defect resulting from complex
  interactions between genetic and environmental factors. While whole exome
  sequencing has identified several pathogenic variants in Indian cohorts, the
  contribution of chromosomal imbalances and long contiguous stretches of
  homozygosity (LCSHs) remains underexplored. Chromosomal microarray analysis
  (CMA) provides a powerful approach to detect such genomic alterations.

  In this pilot study, genomic DNA from three patients with spina bifida was
  analysed using the Affymetrix 750K high-density array platform to identify
  submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances and LCSHs. Detected variants were
  evaluated using public databases including the Database of Genomic Variants,
  ClinVar, and OMIM, followed by functional annotation of affected genes.

  Significant LCSHs involving genes critical to neural tube development,
  including SOX11, WNT7A, FZD9, SEMA3A, and VHL, were identified on chromosomes 2,
  3, and 7. Mosaic Klinefelter syndrome was detected in one patient, while another
  showed no clinically relevant abnormalities. These findings highlight the
  diagnostic value of CMA in uncovering clinically relevant genomic alterations
  in spina bifida.

  This study underscores the importance of integrating chromosomal microarray
  analysis into the genetic evaluation of spina bifida and supports larger-scale
  investigations in the Indian population.
