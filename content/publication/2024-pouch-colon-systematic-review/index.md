abstract: >
  Congenital pouch colon (CPC) is a rare anorectal malformation with a distinct
  geographic prevalence, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. This study
  presents a systematic review and functional enrichment analysis to delineate
  the genetic landscape underlying CPC. Genes reported across published studies
  were curated and subjected to pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses
  to identify biological processes and molecular pathways potentially involved
  in CPC pathogenesis. The findings highlight key developmental and signaling
  pathways that may contribute to disease etiology and provide a consolidated
  genomic framework to guide future functional and translational research in
  congenital pouch colon.

## Abstract

### Background
Despite extensive clinical documentation, few studies have explored the genetic
basis of congenital pouch colon (CPC). Understanding the underlying genetic
architecture is crucial for early diagnosis, personalised treatment strategies,
and effective genetic counselling.

### Objective
To compile and synthesise existing evidence on the genetic basis of CPC and to
perform functional enrichment analysis of the implicated molecular pathways.

### Materials and Methods
This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.
Genes implicated in CPC across published studies were curated and analysed for
underlying molecular pathways. Protein–protein interaction networks were
constructed using the STRING database, followed by gene ontology and pathway
enrichment analyses.

### Results
The review included 20 CPC cases and 52 controls across four studies. Multiple
genetic variants were identified, including 24 missense single nucleotide
polymorphisms, 63 frameshift variants, and several stop-gain and stop-loss
mutations across 11 genes. Key genetic markers included *MUC5B*, *FRG1*, and
*TAF1B*, which are potentially involved in mucosal barrier integrity, colonic
muscular development, and ribosomal RNA transcription, respectively.

Copy number variants and the long non-coding RNA *lnc-EPB41-1-1* were also
implicated. Genetic hotspots were identified on chromosomes 11, 17, and 16.
Additionally, *RGPD2* and *RGPD4*, associated with GTPase activator activity and
bowel/colon function, were differentially expressed. Pathway enrichment analysis
highlighted the involvement of Wnt and HOX signalling pathways, with *JAG1* and
*MLL* emerging as genes of potential relevance to CPC pathogenesis.

### Conclusion
This study integrates genetic evidence with functional pathway analysis to
elucidate the complex genetic architecture of congenital pouch colon. While the
importance of genetic markers in the etiopathogenesis of CPC is underscored, the
findings emphasise the need for validation in larger cohorts, diverse
populations, and through functional experimental studies.
