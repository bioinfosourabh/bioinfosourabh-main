abstract: >
  Congenital pouch colon (CPC) is a rare anorectal malformation with a distinct
  geographic prevalence, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. This study
  presents a systematic review and functional enrichment analysis to delineate
  the genetic landscape underlying CPC. Genes reported across published studies
  were curated and subjected to pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses
  to identify biological processes and molecular pathways potentially involved
  in CPC pathogenesis. The findings highlight key developmental and signaling
  pathways that may contribute to disease etiology and provide a consolidated
  genomic framework to guide future functional and translational research in
  congenital pouch colon.
