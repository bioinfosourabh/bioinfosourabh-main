  Spina bifida is a complex neural tube defect with substantial genetic
  heterogeneity. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of spina
  bifida in an Indian cohort using whole-exome sequencing and pathway enrichment
  analyses. Pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance
  (VUS) were identified and evaluated for functional relevance to neural tube
  development.

  Whole-exome sequencing was performed in a pilot cohort of spina bifida patients
  (n = 3). Identified variants were analysed for protein–protein interactions and
  functional associations using STRING and KEGG pathway analyses, followed by
  literature validation. Particular emphasis was placed on the Wnt/planar cell
  polarity signalling pathway, which is critical for neural tube closure.

  The cohort shared 40 common VUS, including eight deleterious single nucleotide
  polymorphisms involving AP3D1, NLRP9, PCDHGA11, PRSS3, MTSS2, ENDOV, C9, and
  NSD3. These genes are implicated in neural development, immune response, and
  cellular processes essential for neural tube formation. Notably, functional
  interactions were observed between NLGN2, PKD1, PRSS3, and PLK1 with CTNNB1,
  a key regulator of Wnt signalling during embryogenesis.

  This study identifies novel genetic variants and pathways potentially
  contributing to the etiopathogenesis of spina bifida in the Indian population
  and underscores the need for larger cohorts and functional validation to assess
  their clinical relevance.

## Abstract

### Objective
To investigate the genetic basis of spina bifida in an Indian cohort using
whole-exome sequencing and pathway enrichment analyses.

### Methods
Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified through whole-exome
sequencing in a pilot cohort of spina bifida patients (n = 3). Pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, and VUS were analysed for protein–protein interactions and functional
associations with genes implicated in spina bifida using STRING and KEGG pathway
analyses. All findings were further validated through an extensive literature
review, with particular focus on the Wnt/planar cell polarity signalling pathway,
which plays a critical role in neural tube closure.

### Results
The study cohort shared 40 common VUS, including eight deleterious single
nucleotide polymorphisms involving *AP3D1*, *NLRP9*, *PCDHGA11*, *PRSS3*, *MTSS2*,
*ENDOV*, *C9*, and *NSD3*. These genes are functionally associated with neural
development, immune response, and cellular processes essential for neural tube
formation. Notably, functional interactions were observed between *NLGN2*,
*PKD1*, *PRSS3*, and *PLK1* with *CTNNB1*, a key regulator of Wnt signalling during
embryonic neural tube development.

### Conclusions
This study identifies novel genetic variants and molecular pathways that may
contribute to the etiopathogenesis of spina bifida in the Indian population. The
findings underscore the importance of pathway-based interpretation of genomic
data and highlight the need for larger cohorts and functional validation studies
to assess the clinical relevance of these variants.
