  Spina bifida is a complex congenital neural tube defect with significant
  genetic heterogeneity. This study investigates the spectrum of genetic
  variants associated with spina bifida in an Indian cohort. Using high-throughput
  genomic approaches, pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance
  were identified and analysed to understand their contribution to disease
  susceptibility. The findings provide insight into the underlying genetic
  architecture of spina bifida in the Indian population and highlight candidate
  genes and pathways relevant to neural tube development, offering potential
  implications for diagnosis, counselling, and future research.

## Abstract

### Objective
To identify genetic markers associated with spina bifida through a systematic
survey of the exome in an Indian cohort.

### Materials and Methods
Three consecutive patients with spina bifida (lumbosacral meningomyelocele) were
included in the study (P1: 1-year-old male; P2: 2.8-year-old male; P3: 10-year-old
female). Whole-exome sequencing was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon
V8 library, followed by 2 × 150 bp paired-end sequencing (mean coverage ~100×) on
the NovaSeq 6000 platform.

Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using SMART-One™ (secondary analysis) and
SMARTer™ (tertiary analysis) pipelines, including automated quality control,
alignment to the GRCh38/hg38 reference genome, variant calling, and annotation
using ClinVar, OMIM, dbSNP (avsnp150), 1000 Genomes (v5b), ExAC (v0.3), gnomAD
(v4.0), and ESP6500. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (ClinVar/InterVar),
non-synonymous exonic variants with read depth ≥5 were filtered and matched
against the Familial Neural Tube Defects (FNTD) Panel (version 1.10).

### Results
Pathogenic variants overlapping with the FNTD panel included *MTRR*, *CC2D2A*,
and *ZIC2* in patients P1 and P2, and *TGIF1* exclusively in P1, while no such
variants were identified in P3. Novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants
shared across all three patients included *PRUNE1*, *PKD1*, *PDZD2*, and *DAB2*,
identified in both homozygous and heterozygous states, as well as *PLK1* and
*NLGN2*.

The potential role of these variants in the etiopathogenesis of spina bifida was
further explored through an extensive literature review.

### Conclusions
The genetic landscape of spina bifida in this Indian cohort demonstrates
substantial diversity when compared with reports from other populations. This
study provides a comprehensive catalogue of single-nucleotide variants
potentially contributing to the etiopathogenesis of spina bifida within the
framework of the Familial Neural Tube Defects Panel, supporting the need for
population-specific genomic investigations.
