abstract: >
  Spina bifida is a complex congenital neural tube defect with significant
  genetic heterogeneity. This study investigates the spectrum of genetic
  variants associated with spina bifida in an Indian cohort. Using high-throughput
  genomic approaches, pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance
  were identified and analysed to understand their contribution to disease
  susceptibility. The findings provide insight into the underlying genetic
  architecture of spina bifida in the Indian population and highlight candidate
  genes and pathways relevant to neural tube development, offering potential
  implications for diagnosis, counselling, and future research.
