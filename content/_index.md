  I develop analysis algorithms in the realms of genomics, reproducible computational research,
  and clinical translation, with a strong focus on cancer genomics and rare
  diseases. Outside the lab, I’m usually
  behind a camera or planning my next high-altitude trek, experiences that
  shape how I think about observation, persistence.
